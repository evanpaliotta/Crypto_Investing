## Proposal
Our project is to create and compare a short-term algorithmic trading strategy with a medium-term buy and hold strategy. In reference to our short term strategy, we utilize the RSI and MACD while implementing regression and natural language processing in our buy and hold strategy. The latter strategy uses daily BTC exchange rate data and focuses on nine currencies with three distinct use cases.  We gathered data from the Binance API for both strategies and the Reddit API for NLP. Finally we compared the returns of the models and ultimately determined which strategy is more profitable to implement.
